### Important Notice

While Cloudflare R2 operates on a strongly consistent model ([reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/reference/consistency/)), it's important to note that `lowstorage` is primarily designed for small, hobby, or personal projects. We advise extreme caution when using `lowstorage` for critical applications or production environments, as it may not offer the robustness or features required for such use cases.

### Usage

```js
import lowstorage from 'lowstorage';
// Initialize object and get users collection
const usersCol = await lowstorage(env, 'MY_TESTING_BUCKET').collection('users');

// Add new user
// you can provide _id or it will be generated as crypto.randomUUID();  -> https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/
const newUser = await usersCol.insert({
	name: 'Kevin',
	gender: 'whatever',
	posts: [],
});

// Find users with pagination (e.g., page 2, 10 users per page)
const secondPageUsers = await usersCol.find().skip(10).limit(10);

// Show all users
const allUsers = usersCol.find({});

// Find user by ID and update name
await usersCol.update({ _id: id }, { name: 'Carlos' });
```

## API

**collection(colName)**

- **Input**: A string representing the name of the collection.
- **Behavior**: Creates or accesses a collection with the given name.
- **Returns**: An instance of the Collection class corresponding to the specified collection name.

- **insert(doc)**

  - **Input**: A single object or an array of objects.
  - **Behavior**: Inserts the given document(s) into the collection. Each document is assigned a unique identifier if it doesn't already have one.
  - **Returns**: A promise that resolves when the insert operation is complete.

- **find(query)**

  - **Input**: A query object (e.g., `{_id: id}`).
  - **Behavior**: Searches for documents that match the query.
  - **Returns**: A promise that resolves to an array of matching documents.

- **_skip(numToSkip)_** Skips the specified number of documents in query results. Use this for pagination (e.g., skipping the first page of results). Returns the updated collection instance to allow chaining.

- **_limit(numToLimit)_** Limits the number of documents returned by query results. Use this for pagination (e.g., limiting to 10 results per page). Returns the updated collection instance to allow chaining.

- **findOne(query)**

  - **Input**: A query object.
  - **Behavior**: Similar to `find`, but it returns only the first matching document.
  - **Returns**: A promise that resolves to a single document or `null` if no match is found.

- **update(query, update)**

  - **Input**: A query object and an update object.
  - **Behavior**: Updates all documents that match the query with the provided update data.
  - **Returns**: A promise that resolves to the number of documents updated.

- **updateOne(query, update)**

  - **Input**: A query object and an update object.
  - **Behavior**: Updates the first document that matches the query with the provided update data.
  - **Returns**: A promise that resolves to `1` if a document is updated, otherwise `0`.

- **delete(query)**

  - **Input**: A query object.
  - **Behavior**: Deletes documents that match the query.
  - **Returns**: A promise that resolves to the number of documents deleted.

- **remove()**

  - **Behavior**: Removes all documents from the collection.
  - **Returns**: A promise that resolves to the number of documents removed.

- **count(query)**
  - **Input**: A query object (optional).
  - **Behavior**: Counts the number of documents that match the query. If no query is provided, it counts all documents in the collection.
  - **Returns**: A promise that resolves to the count of matching documents.

**listCollections()**

- **Behavior**: Lists all collections stored in the Cloudflare R2 bucket associated with the lowstorage instance. (All files ending with .json)
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to an array of collection names.
